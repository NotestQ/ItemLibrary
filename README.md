## Dependencies

## Mod Usage

## Additions
By itself, this does nothing! This is a library that handles ID assignment and other QoL features for mod developers!

## Issues
If the mod is throwing an error use [the github issues page](https://github.com/NotestQ/ItemLibrary/issues) and copy-paste the error in there, with a description of what is happening and what you expected to happen if applicable. Or just ping me at the Content Warning Modding Discord server!
